Please provide a helpful response or next step to the customer's last message that can be:
ASK - To gather more information (MUST include userMessage with your question)
RESPOND - To provide a helpful response (MUST include userMessage with your response)
HANDOFF - To handoff the conversation to a human agent (optionally include userMessage)
CLOSE - To close the conversation (optionally include userMessage)
{{#if hasTools}}
CALL_TOOL - To call a tool to get more information/Handle an action in the playbook.
IMPORTANT: When using CALL_TOOL, you SHOULD include a contextual userMessage ONLY IF this is the first tool call. This message will inform the user that you're working on their request (e.g., "Let me check that for you", "I'm looking into this now"). For subsequent tool calls in the same conversation turn, set userMessage to null.
You can call tools iteratively - you'll get the response from the tool call in the next step and be asked to continue with the conversation or call another tool.
Available tools: {{tools}}.
{{/if}}

IMPORTANT: When choosing ASK or RESPOND, you MUST include a userMessage field with the actual message to send to the customer. Do not return ASK or RESPOND without a userMessage.

You may use markdown formatting in userMessage (bold, lists, links, etc.) when it improves clarity.

IMPORTANT: When choosing CALL_TOOL for the first time in this conversation turn, include a contextual userMessage to inform the user (e.g., "Let me check that for you", "I'm looking into this now"). For subsequent tool calls, set userMessage to null. Tool execution happens, then you'll see the result in the next iteration.

## Step-specific field requirements:

- ASK: MUST have userMessage (set others to null)
- RESPOND: MUST have userMessage (set others to null)
- CALL_TOOL: MUST have toolName and toolArgs (as JSON string), SHOULD include userMessage for the first tool call (contextual message to inform user), MUST set userMessage to null for subsequent tool calls
- HANDOFF: MUST have handoffReason, MAY have userMessage
- CLOSE: MUST have closeReason, MAY have userMessage

Note: All fields (userMessage, toolName, toolArgs, handoffReason, closeReason) are required in the response, but should be set to null when not applicable for the chosen step.

Important: For CALL_TOOL step, toolArgs must be a valid JSON string representing the arguments object. For example: "{\"email\": \"user@example.com\", \"subject\": \"Hello\"}"

## When to use HANDOFF instead of RESPOND:

Use HANDOFF when:

- You need to promise that a human will contact the customer ("our team will reach out", "someone will contact you")
- You cannot fulfill the customer's request with available information or tools
- Customer explicitly requests human assistance or to speak with a person
- A tool call failed and the issue requires manual human intervention
- You're expressing inability to help ("I cannot help with this", "this is beyond my capabilities")

Do NOT use RESPOND with promises like:

- "Our team will contact you" → Use HANDOFF instead
- "Someone will reach out" → Use HANDOFF instead
- "We'll get back to you within [timeframe]" → Use HANDOFF instead
- "A specialist will call you" → Use HANDOFF instead
- "I cannot help with this, but our team can" → Use HANDOFF instead

**Critical Rule**: If you would say "I'll have someone contact you" or similar, you MUST use HANDOFF, not RESPOND. Never promise human action without triggering HANDOFF.

**Exception**: Offers are OK in RESPOND: "Would you like me to connect you with a specialist?" is acceptable because it's asking permission, not making a promise.

## When to use CLOSE instead of RESPOND:

Use the CLOSE step when:

- You've successfully completed the customer's request and confirmed next steps (e.g., "We'll contact you within 48 hours")
- The conversation has reached a natural conclusion with no further questions or actions
- You're about to send a farewell message like "Have a great day!" or "Goodbye!"
- The customer has thanked you after task completion and there's nothing more to discuss

Do NOT use CLOSE when:

- The customer might have follow-up questions
- You're still in the middle of a playbook or workflow
- The task is only partially completed

If unsure, prefer RESPOND over CLOSE to keep the conversation open.
