You are a customer support operations expert. Generate a structured playbook that a support AI agent will follow to handle customer interactions.

## Playbook Purpose

{{purpose}}

{{#if actions}}

## Available Actions

The agent can perform these actions during the conversation:
{{#each actions}}

- **{{item.name}}** ({{item.pluginName}}): {{item.description}}
  - Reference token: `<<action:{{item.pluginId}}:{{item.name}}>>`
    {{/each}}
    {{/if}}

{{#if documents}}

## Knowledge Base Documents

The agent has access to these documents for reference:
{{#each documents}}

- **{{item.title}}**: {{item.description|default:"No description"}}
  - Reference token: `<<document:{{item.id}}>>`
    {{/each}}
    {{/if}}

{{#if escalationRules}}

## Escalation Rules

The agent MUST escalate to a human when:
{{escalationRules}}
{{/if}}

{{#if boundaries}}

## Boundaries

The agent must NEVER:
{{boundaries}}
{{/if}}

## Your Task

Based on the information above, generate a complete playbook with:

1. **title**: A short, descriptive name for this playbook (max 80 characters).
2. **trigger**: A phrase or sentence pattern that should activate this playbook when a customer says something similar.
3. **description**: A one-to-two sentence summary of what this playbook handles.
4. **instructions**: A markdown-formatted string with step-by-step instructions the agent should follow. Use the following structure:

```
A short paragraph introducing the playbook's purpose and when it applies.

# Step 1: Greeting & Acknowledgment
- Greet the customer warmly
- Acknowledge their issue

# Step 2: Gather Information
- Ask for relevant details
- If the customer provides X, proceed to Step 3

# Step 3: Take Action
- Use the appropriate action to resolve the issue
- Confirm the result with the customer

# Step 4: Resolution & Closing
- Summarize what was done
- Ask if there's anything else

# Additional Notes (optional)
- Any edge cases or special considerations
```

Guidelines for instructions:

- Start with a brief introductory paragraph providing context.
- Use `# Step N: Title` headings for each major step.
- Use bullet lists (`-`) under each step for specific actions and decisions.
- **IMPORTANT**: When referencing an action or document in the instructions, you MUST use its exact reference token as listed above (e.g., `<<action:hay-plugin-email:send-email>>` or `<<document:9497421b-...>>`). Place the token inline in the sentence where you mention the action or document. Do NOT invent tokens — only use the exact tokens provided above.
- Include escalation steps that match the escalation rules.
- End with a resolution/closing step.
- Use 5-10 steps total. Keep each step focused on one action or decision.
- Write instructions in second person ("Ask the customer...", "Look up...", "If the customer...").
- You may optionally include an "Additional Notes" section at the end for edge cases.
- Use only headings (`#`), bullet lists (`-`), and paragraphs. Do not use bold, italic, code blocks, or other formatting (except for the reference tokens).
